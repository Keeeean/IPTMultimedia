            CPU stands for the

            <span>Central Processing Unit</span>

            <p>This is the piece of hardware in the computer that enables it to interact with applications and programmes
            </p>

            <p>Simply put, it is the component of the computer that opens applications and executables. Most games are executables!</p>

            <p>This is the piece of hardware in the computer that allows open application a place to store and access data on a short-term basis.</p>

            <p>For example, you're probably using a web-browser to look at this website. The web-browser takes up storage in your RAM to access the data that is on this site! </p>

            <p>It works as a complement to the CPU and reduce workloads for the CPU. For example, the CPU is in charge of the calculations that happen in the computer, while GPU is in charge of the computer graphic workloads.</p>

            <p>Every computer has integrated graphics, which means that the graphics processing unit is within the CPU, however there are external graphics cards, known as dedicated graphics card </p>
